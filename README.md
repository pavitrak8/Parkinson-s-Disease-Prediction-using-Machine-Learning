## proposed feature selection called "FISHER SCORE BASED RECURSIVE FEATURE ELIMINATION"
Parkinson's disease is a neurological syndrome that manifests slowly and gradually, making it
difficult to diagnose at an early stage. Voice alterations can be used as a detectable marker of early
detection. The synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is employed to address class
imbalance issue in the datasets. For optimal feature selection, a novel approach called Fisher Score based Recursive Feature Elimination (FRFE) is proposed, and it is compared with state of art feature
selection methods namely Correlation Coefficient, Mutual Information, Backward Feature
Elimination, Recursive Feature Elimination. The performance of models was evaluated across
different classifiers using two voice datasets, with different features so as to confirm that FRFE works
for any dataset irrespective of features. The FRFE performs better than the state of methods of
comparison in terms of accuracy and variance.
